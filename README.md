## How to run this project

#### This project is hosted at http://cheapandnice.herokuapp.com

You can clone it and run it locally too, but you would need to configure the REACT_APP_API enviroment variable which should point to your local server, and you'd also need the backend project found here https://github.com/duacos/cheapandnice-backend (Note that it has it's own configuration, [README](https://github.com/duacos/cheapandnice-backend/blob/master/README.md) )
